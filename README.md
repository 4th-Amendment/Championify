Championify is a little program that downloads all the recent item sets from popular websites like Champion.gg, Lolflavor, and KoreanBuilds, and imports them in to your League of Legends to use within game! No hassle. Championify supports 39 languages and with plenty of new features planned and in the works!

Windows and OSX are both supported, tested on Windows 10 and OSX 10.11.3.

## Command Line Parameters
Championify supports a few command line parameters for those who would like to automate a few tasks before it's official supported within the app. Params work on both Windows and OSX, and uses the last saved preferences made on the app (preferences are saved each time you hit import). The command line prefs do need improvement and can be tracked [here](https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/issues/165).

__Params__

- `--import` Imports item sets
- `--delete` Deletes item sets
- `--autorun` Silently (without loading the UI) imports item sets
- `--close` Closes Championify when finished
- `--startLeague` Starts League of Legends after import

__Example__

Silently imports and starts League afterwards.

```bash
C:/Championify/championify.exe --autorun --startLeague
```


## Bleeding Edge
For the adventurous, bleeding edge builds are available of each branch through CIs. A simpler method will be available once a website is built.

__Windows__

Open [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dustinblackman/championify/branch/master) and select the the latest master branch commit, then `Platform: x86`, then `artifacts`. You'll find `download.txt` that contains a Zippyshare link to the build off that commit.

__OSX__

Open [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/dustinblackman/Championify/branches) and select the the latest master branch commit, scroll down through the test log until you see `npm run build-artifact`, a few lines down you should see a Zippyshare link to the build off that commit.


<a name="source" />
## Build From Source
You must have Node 4.1.1 and NPM 3.8.5 installed on your system (thats what Electron is using), git clone the repo and run the following in the root folder.

__OSX:__
```console
npm i
npm run build
```

__Windows:__
```console
npm i --arch=ia32
npm run build
```

You'll find a Championify.exe/Championify.app in the releases folder.

Wine is required if building on Mac for Windows.
```console
brew install wine
```

Soon Championify will be expanding, big! With plenty of suggestions and new ideas, Championify will be making it's way to the web and mobile. This will unfortunately have server costs in order to get started and keep running. A couple bucks is more then enough to help! :) [Donate here!](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/championify)
