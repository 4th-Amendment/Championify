# Championify
_Champion-If-Ayyy_

Championify is a little program that downloads all the recent builds from Champion.gg and imports them in to your League of Legends to use within game! No hassle. Now with support customization settings and a GUI!

Windows and OSX are both supported, tested on Windows 8.1 and OSX 10.10.1. Check out some screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/umDkx5j,scpQPBH,GpHtwKt#0)!

Note this application is still in development, as far as I've tested it's worked great, but don't get overly surprised if you find a bug or two.

This application is inspired by [ebildude123](https://github.com/ebildude123/champion.gg-item-set-creator) item set creator done in PHP.

<a name="faq" />
## FAQ
### Be more descriptive, what does this actually do?
Well it's easy really. Here's a link for [Teemo's most popular build in top lane](http://champion.gg/champion/Teemo) that Champion.gg has tracked. We take this information and save it in a way that League of Legends likes so you can have the exact builds in game!


### Is it safe?
Yep it's safe! Were not modifying League of Legends at all, so no rules broken there. And my code is clean and free to browse, so no smelly virus' or surprises. I've added VirusTotal report to all my recent releases just to be sure. If you still don't trust my executables, have a tech buddy look over my code themselves and you can build from [source](#source).


### Why do I not see the item sets in the launcher?
Due to Riot restrictions, you can only see the item sets in game, you won't see them in the launcher.


### How do I make this work on Windows?
Run Championify.exe, the app will try and look for your League of Legends folder for you. If the app can't find it, browse to your League of Legends folder where lol.launcher.exe is saved (LoLLauncher.exe for Garena installations).


### How do I make this work on Mac?
Run Championify, the app will try and look for your League of Legends.app for you. If the app can't find it, browse and select your League of Legends.app.


### AAHHHH! SOMETHING BROKE! IT'S ALL MESSED UP!
Calm down, I gotcha! If something went wrong it means something has changed that I did not expect. Follow the steps [below](#uninstall) in the next FAQ question to remove Championify's builds.


<a name="uninstall" />
### Nah bro, I don't like this. How can I delete all your builds?
I'm sorry you don't like it, hopefully I'll have it live up to your expectations one day! As for deleting, first head over to your League of Legends builds directory _C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/Config/Champions/_ for Windows, _/Applications/League of Legends/Contents/LoL/Config/Champions/_ for Mac.

Now you have two options.

Delete all the folders, and be done with it! However you will lose any other builds that other apps might of installed, BUT NOT your Item Sets that you did within the launcher. Those are safe.

**OR**

Go in each folder one by one and delete all files starting with _CGG._


### Should I be running this everyday?
Oh no not at all, that's the last thing you want to do. The best time to run Championify is 3-4 day after a major patch comes out. Only got to do it once.


### If this has been done before, why did you do it again?
Well for a few reasons. [ebildude123](https://github.com/ebildude123/champion.gg-item-set-creator) original script is in PHP, and I wanted to do some changes and I don't like PHP in the slightest. Another issue is that the greater part of the world doesn't have PHP installed by default making the use of his script very difficult, plus you have a good number of people who automatically run in fear when they have to open a command prompt. My solution is a simple .exe/.app where you run and follow the instructions. Much easier.


### Why is your script so slow?
Well damn, you must be pretty impatient if you think that's slow... The script is slowed on purpose so users don't spam Champion.gg's servers. They're doing great great stuff over there and the last thing I'd want to do is cause them trouble. However if it's REALLY slow, then you should consider upgrading your dial up connection.


### Why is the file size so big?
I use Electron to wrap my GUI, and unfortunately it's a bit big. I'd rather the App just work then worry about size.


### BUT WAIT! I have a suggestion!
Well that's great! Put up an Issue or send me a message on reddit [/u/dustinheroin](https://www.reddit.com/user/dustinheroin) and I'll try to get it when I can. If you can code Coffeescript, feel free to make a pull request. :)

## Future Plans
- Automatically elevate when required instead of making the user do it.
- Get my own Championify Icon.


##### Nerdy Future Plans
- Take better advantage of lodash.
- Gulp task to auto generate Github Releases with VirusTotal reports and Changelog parsing.

## Build From Source
You must have NodeJS installed on your system, last tested with NodeJS 0.12.2. Git clone the repo and run the following in the root folder.

```console
npm install -g gulp
npm install
npm run build
```

You'll find a compiled executable zipped in the releases folder.
