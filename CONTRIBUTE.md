## Contribute
If you can code Coffeescript, feel free to make a pull request.
Make sure to check out my [Zenhub board](https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify#boards?repos=34264106) so we don't have any conflicts if I or someone else has already started on an issue. :)

#### Rules:
- Must pass all tests. `npm test`
- Must write tests for all new functions (look at current tests for examples, still a WIP).
- Functions must be camel cased. `downloadStuff()`
- Variables must be underscored. `my_champion = 'teemo'`
- PR must be off and back to master branch.

I suggest making sure your linters are setup correctly, or run gulp lint every now and again.

### Translations
I use a [Onesky](https://dustinblackman.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project/95440) to manage all my translations, it's super easy, includes initial English text, screenshots, and lets everyone contribute! Check it out. Make sure to check if a translation has been done already before writing it over again, as it does take me quite a bit of time if there's a lot to go over.

Please prevent from putting translations in PRs, I'd rather keep those for code.
